Abstract: llergic reactions arise as a result of exposure to allergens, which have the potential to inflict harm on living organisms. Furthermore, allergies can influence individuals' preferences and utilization of various products, including food and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, it is essential to identify allergenic proteins accurately. In this study, we presented a novel deep learning model, termed PreAlgPro, to predict allergenic proteins based on pre-trained protein language models (PPLMs) and an attention-based convolutional neural network. First, we compared four popular PPLMs and adopted the best one to obtain the embedded features of allergenic proteins. Second, a deep learning architecture was constructed to perform the classification of allergenic proteins by combining the attention mechanism, the convolutional neural network with residual connection, and the fully connected layers. Third, we applied the 5-fold cross-validation and the independent set test to verify the effectiveness of PreAlgPro on the benchmark datasets. Finally, we conducted a case analysis to ascertain the robustness of the model. Based on the same independent test set, PreAlgPro showcased satisfactory performance, with an accuracy of 98.94% and a recall of 98.03%. Our model achieved an overall precision of 99.86%, exhibiting an improvement of 6.55% to 14.72% compared to the existing state-of-the-art predictors. This indicated that PreAlgPro could serve as an efficient method for the allergenic protein identification.
